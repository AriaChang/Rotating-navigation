      <h1>Crafting = Therapy</h1>

      <h2>Why I started crafting</h2>
      <p>I began crafting in 2020 when Covid-19 swept the world. At that time, I desperately needed a job, but due to the faltering economy, finding one was challenging. I believe many can relate to that period. However, my feelings of depression didn't start then. They began when I came to the USA to study in 2014. As a foreigner in a new country, I was excited to learn and had set ambitious goals for myself. Over time, I began to feel pressure as I encountered numerous obstacles during my experiences in the USA. These challenges extended beyond academics and included finding accommodation, meeting familial expectations, navigating visa requirements, seeking employment, adjusting to a different culture, coping with loneliness and language barriers, and even the simple task of scheduling appointments presented difficulties.

        In 2020, I discovered embroidery, initially not expecting to develop such a keen interest in crafting, despite my sister's enthusiasm for it. I was initially skeptical, but upon trying it myself, I found it captivating. It felt almost magical, and I found myself eager to practice it daily, experimenting with various techniques, textures, and tools, eagerly anticipating the final result.</p>

      <h2>It's both magical and therapeutic.</h2>
      <p>As I delve deeper into crafting, I find that I'm channeling my stress into handmade creations, and I feel a sense of fulfillment every time I complete a piece of art. I feel satisfied and happy. Surprisingly, I spend up to 12 hours a day crafting. So, I thought, why not open a store to share this passion with everyone?</p>

      <h2>Why I opened a store</h2>
      <p>To relieve stress, there are many ways, and I'd like to share mine with those experiencing depression. I opened a craft store in August 2022. My products aren't just for funâ€”they also make wonderful handmade gifts for your loved ones. They're suitable for everyone, from simple embroidery patterns to punch needle designs. If you're short on crafting time, I can create products for you on commission. I also offer hand-drawn stationery for those who enjoy collecting cute items. Treat yourself to some adorable art; it's sure to bring positivity!

        Let's craft together and enjoy!</p>
